On this assignment we were to create an e-commerce website that had both customer-facing and admin sections. 
Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

- The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following todayâ€™s trends and design patterns.
- Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.
- Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.
- The website must be responsive on all devices.
- Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.
